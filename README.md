For differential analysis/enrichment between peak calls of two samples

Diffbind is a R bioconductor package. It's primarily used for CHIP-seq datasets but can be used for ATAC data as well.
It used deseq2 (default) or edgeR to normalise and determine fold change between two samples.

All suggestion are welcome
